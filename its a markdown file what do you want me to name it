# _Data Science Project: Console Prices_

# Identifying and Defining

## Mind Map

![My Mindmap](images\mindmap.png)
* Blue were ideas considered for longer than others.

## Hypothesis

#### "Videogame console prices have risen accordingly with inflation, and are as fairly priced as they were 20 years ago."

This includes the following consoles:

| Playstation| Xbox | Nintendo |
|---|---|---|
|PS3 (2006)| Xbox 360 (2006) | Wii (2006) |
|PS4 (2013)| Xbox One (2013)| Wii U (2012) |
|PS5 (2020) | Xbox Series S (2020) | Switch (2017) |
|PS5 Pro (2024) | Xbox Series X (2020) | Switch 2 (2025) |

## Requirements Outline

### Functional Requirements

* #### Loading
All relevant images or texts should be without error. In case of error, backup methods should be used. If those fail, make the error clear to the user and give the user direction to access data in other ways.

* ####  Cleaning
System should be able to function with minor values missing, with minimal disruption to user experience. Tools to filter or locate specific data will ideally be included.

* ####  Analysis
System should be able to provide analysis in the form of means, ranges and other useful tools, especially for comparison.

* #### Visualisation
Data should be visualised in a variety of pertinent ways, such as graphs, charts, dataframes and more. Particular focus should be given to the visualisation methods' accuracy compared to the spreadsheets.

* #### Outputs
Outputs should be in the form of showing the user's chosen visualisation, text representing specifically filtered data points, or easy access to the spreadsheets and datasets. Dataset will likely be stored in a .csv file.


### Non-Functional Requirements

* #### Usability
User interface should be easily navigable, understandable, and simple, whilst providing all neccesary information. A "README" document should be included to clarify what the data is, suggests, and any other necessary information. Data visualisation methods should have clarity.

* #### Reliability
System should be consistently able to access the same data with simple input, mentioned data should have and maintain integrity. System should handle errors without obfuscation, using backup processe(s) and detailed error messages to assist the user


### Use Case
__Actor:__ User

__Goal:__ To access and interact with existing data through the program’s user interface.

__Preconditions:__

* The dataset has already been preloaded into the system by an administrator / programmer.

* The user has access to the system's interface.

__Main Flow:__

User opens the program and is presented with a text-based menu.

User is presented with the following options:
* a. See visualisation (Charts or graphs)
* b. Provide criteria to search or filter for data.
* c. Access the dataset for any reason (typically an update; though other reasons may exist.)

User selects one of the options and system performs the requested action and outputs to user.

__Postconditions:__

User has viewed and/or interacted with the data in any way they choose.

Updates are checked for and saved by the system (if valid).

Data remains available for further queries or analysis, maintaining  data integrity.



# Researching and Planning

## Research:
Below is a collection of links I used for research. I guess it's my sources? At least the ones for the paragraph.

## Discuss (SEE-I Paragraph)

A lot of people seem to think that videogame consoles are overpriced, and the natural inferrence most people take is that that means the companies behind them are marking up prices to increase profits, however, most gaming journalism suggests that consoles are sold at a large loss to their manufacturers. Online, a lot of people appear to have the opinion that consoles have become drastically more expensive across about the past decade. While objectively true, this doesn't account for inflation as others point out, and there's another common logic that because console makers get more profit from selling software, whether it be in retailers, through online shops, or subscription services, they keep the console price point tolerable to enable later purchases. This is seen in the modern XBox business model, as Microsoft eat a loss of over a $100 on each Series X/S sold, often more, but they make up for it with the lucrative Xbox game pass, and it's heavy success. However, what gamers see is an increase in price, and from that perspective, it does make sense to assume they're taking profit. It's like any other thing with inflation, when a person sees their favourite pizza place has raised the price of garlic bread 30%, they're obviously going to be disgruntled, yet that doesn't consider that perhaps the wheat industry had hit a tough spot, and it's priced just as accordingly. Though it is important to note that sometimes companies overdo their price raises, using inflation as an excuse, like certain major supermarket chains do.

## Acquiring Data

Note: Assume data needs to be in the time period of 2005-2025 (where applicable).
#### Data I need:
- Inflation in general across Australia, Japan & the USA,* or globally.
- Manufacturing costs of common console parts. 
- Rise in consumer prices of MAIN (sorry PSP) consoles from Sony, Microsoft & Nintendo.**
- Rise in manufacturing costs of the above consoles.


###### *Depending on ease of data acquisition 1 or 2 of the countries can be dropped.

###### **The companies should be seperated to compare between eachother.

These requirements are very malleable depending on the ease of obtaining and using it. Really all that is truly needed is console prices and inflation, in any usable shape or form. 

Data, when found, will have it's source listed beneath this line.

## Data Dictionary
I'm not sure HOW you're meant to make these, unsure if it should be a table or a dataframe or a .csv or whatever else, so right now I'll just do this as a table and we can figure the rest out later.

Some notes:
- I'm planning on using the GPU as a microchosm of the manufacturing costs as a whole, as there's data about them and its often the most expensive part of a console (at least today).  Update: There is significantly less data about these GPUs than I thought. Alternatives may be used. We'll see.
- There is significantly more information about manufaturing prices, so that will be used.
- USD and AUD are being used out of convinience.
- My knowledge of datatypes is limited so I did my best guesses based on example mostly.
- This has been refurbished late into the project. Still not too reflective of the final dataset, but more fleshed out.



| Field   | Datatype | Display Format | Description | Example | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Console | object | XX...XX | The console whose data is being looked at. | Sega Dreamcast | Any character or number. No other symbols. |
| Company | object | X...X | The videogame company behind the console. | Atari | Unlimited |
| Price (USD) | float64 | NNN | Rounded up consumer price of the console on release, in USD. | 250 | Three numbers with no decimal places. |
| Price (AUD) | float64 | NNN/NNNN* | Rounded up consumer price of the console on release, in AUD. | 450 | Three or Four numbers with no decimal places. |
| Units sold (million) | float64 | N...N.N | No. Sales of the console, in millions. | 29.0 | One–Three numbers and a decimal place.
| Manufacturing Price (USD) | float64 | NN/NNN* | Rounded up price of the console's GPU on release, in USD | 170 | Two or three numbers with no decimal places. |
| Release Year | int64 | NNNN | Year where the console released internationally. | 2008 | Four integers. |

*I don't know how to represent different potential amounts of numbers in the display format.

# Producing and Implementing

#### There's very little to say about this phase in the markdown. For the code, see main.py and data module.py.

# Testing and Evaluating

## Test your Analysis
Here are some of the seemingly accurate results of my program's functions.

### Visualisation: Console Prices

![Major Console Prices](images\Figure_1_ConsolePrices.jpeg)

Here we see the release price of each major console since 2005, in release order. While there are notable outliers, and the data is certainly influenced by many different factors, there is a trend towards higher prices over time, especially with Nintendo who's prices never fall in the graph. We can also see that Playstation consoles oftentimes release at bery high prices compared to others. XBox have the most consistent prices, with the range between their cheapest and mos texpensive being only about $200.


![USA Inflation ](images\Figure_2_US_Inflation.png)

Using the increasing value of a 2005 USD  to track inflation, we see that the increase has been relatively steady, though notably increasing at a heightened rate past 2020. What this means is that the prices have increased by about x1.6, and as such the dollar buys only ~60% of what it used too. United States currency is used because it is the most common currency in global trade, and has a high amount of English-language data on it. The USA is also the largest market for videogame consoles.


![Price of Consoles as Inflation increases](images\Figure_3_Prices-as-inflation-rises.png)

Seen here is console prices plotted with the prior inflation data as the time. This shows a relative standardisation for many years, with some drops. When using other data we can see that said drops are mostly Nintendo consoles, and also that the drops have gotten smaller in recent years. The PS5 Pro displays a massive spike in price, which may indicate that the future holds higher prices overall.

### Filtered Data
The filter function produces useful data to draw conclusions.

## Analysis and Conclusion

### The Hypothesis from the beginning:
#### "Videogame console prices have risen accordingly with inflation, and are as fairly priced as they were 20 years ago."

The information I gained from my data suggests that, largely, console prices have risen accordingly with inflation, and, notably have never taken large profits. Generally, most consoles lingered around $400 for quite some time, though with Nintendo's being lower than XBox and Playstation. In the data for manufacturing prices it's worth noting that margins were quite thin for most consoles, and the data doesn't even show other associated costs like shippng and retailers' cuts. This suggests that the business model used to be more focused around distribution than profit on consoles, and I would argue that that hasn't changed (except the PS5 Pro). The inflation data suggests that the purchasing power of a USD is around x 0.6 weaker than in 2005, and that is around how much the console prices have risen, specifically in recent years, which can likely be accredited to the pandemic. Take Nintendo's prices, the Wii was $250 on release, which multiplied by 1.6 gets to $400. While not exactly the same as the US NS2 Price, it explains a large rise in prices, especially when you again see the manufacturing prices on those two consoles, which is a much larger difference of $240. To illustrate, think of it as a fresh fruit stall. Their most recent plantation cost more due to increased demand, and the new trees are taller and thus need more labour to get the apples down. These two factors, among many others, naturally lead to a price increase, and it's the same for consoles with the inflation and manufacturing costs both rising. As such, having conluded my research, I now hold the opinion that videogame consoles like the PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch 2 ARE fairly priced, as were consoles like the Wii and Xbox 360.

**This conclusion is also included in the program, under function 4.**


## Peer Verification

Benji exchanged with quite a few people as far as I know, including me. I was unsure whether I was supposed to include the feedback I got or the feedback I gave, so I did both.


#### My feedback to Benji
| Plus | Minus | Implication |
|---|---|---|
|Easy and simple UI was well-done, making the program navigable. Everything about the visualisations were excellent, communicating data I did not understand in other forms into interesting graphs. Error handling was smart. Special commendations to the year-filtering function, which was inexplicably intriguing. Additionally, the data goes back an entire 75 years. | The UX was somewhat small, especially with my basic understanding of the dataset. While not directly related to the hypothesis, the other stats in the dataset would've been interesting to see visualised. | Overall a fantastic piece of work that allows for a good user experience, with outstanding visualisation functions, which I definitely used somewhat excessively. The data was easy-to-verify, and matches up with the sourced data (though, I don't understand much of it), making for clearly correct and good data, bolstered by a great scale. My only concerns are but minor nitpicks. Clearly a lot of effort was put into this, and it paid off. |


#### Benji's feedback to me.
| Plus | Minus | Implication |
|---|---|---|
|It is obvious that a lot of effort was put into this project. The program is very in depth, there are multiple options for everything, like viewing datasets. There are also multiple graphs which help to visualise the data. UX is clean and efficient, and error handling seemed to be sound. | The consumer price index graph is a little hard to understand. Also, there is limited filtering. You can look for a specific data point, however you can't filter the graphs. | The program is overall extremely solid. It is well tailored to experienced users with a good grasp of economics terminology. There is a lot of information packed into this program, and the user experience ensures that even if you are not an expert, there is still useful data to be found. It achieves its aim of showing console prices quite well. Great work. |




## Evaluation

### Requirements Outline

* #### Loading
All images, datasets, data in general, and text loads without error, consistently as needed.

* ####  Cleaning
Tools to filter and locate specific data were included. System has not had any errors in regards to missing data, but testing indicates that all unrelated functionality remains fine when data is remove.

* ####  Analysis
The system does not have dedicated analysis tools like the ones listed prior, though options to show the data in numerous ways were included for users to interpret information easily.

* #### Visualisation
Data is visualised using several graphs that illustrate it in generally-understandable ways, as well as easily shown in a dataframe. The functions are easily understandable as a whole, and data is represented well.

* #### Outputs
Outputs work without error, clearly responding to user input with anything requested, as well as fun flavour text in parts. Data is stored in well-filed csv files, with other things easily accessible.


### Peer Feedback

The feedback I recieved highlighted my program's vast optionality and visualisations, which I found quite good as well, so I think I largely did well in that regard. My UX was well-done, which was a hope of mine, and I myself was worried about the error handling however it seems like it was fine. Supposedly, the filtering was limited, which I agree with as the feature was somewhat last minute, and I think I could improve it by giving it more depth, rather than solely focusing on going by company or console, and I could do to reword the inflation graph. Overall my feedback was positive, boding well and supporting my overall positive outlook on the project.


### Project Management
I'm actually quite proud of myself in regards to the management of this project. From the beginning, I was hardworking every lesson, and I did my best to stick on course. My commit history is quite long now, as I've worked steadily, even if not that quickly. When I began to feel myself falling behind, not out of lack of work but simple roadblocks, I made sure to do enough work at home to catch up, which I've continued lightly as to ensure completion. Modifications to the scope were quite prevalent, as needed, but I was overall able to fulfill most of my goals with a still reasonable amount of time. That being said, having looked at my commits, I did do a LOT in the last week. Not a ridiculous amount, I found it quite easy, but it does look quite bad for me. So, the project management was really good this time, steady, consistent, and I was overall never ahead but rarely behind the expectation. Yippee.

### Data Quality
My data is, in majority, well-gathered with objective accuracy in almost every field. Some downloaded entries may be outdated, as consdata.csv was originally an online file (it has been heavily modified with far more stuff), which may mean that some data for recent entries are likely from it's creation date. Additionally, certain extremely recent entries, like those for the PS5 Pro and Nintendo Switch 2, were extremely difficult to find information on, especially for things like sales and manufacturing costs, and as such are likely somewhat or totally innacurate. However, I can say with relative certainty that all of the data is unbiased, due to the objectivity of just about every metric used. Almost any given entry can simply be found online, verified by various sources.

### Security and User Experience Improvemtns
There are ways in which the security and user experience could be improved, though I am happy with the state of both of them. For instance, there was a scrapped password function that would've benefitted security, as passwords are just security 101. The format of the files obviously hurts security, as they are contained without obfuscation in the same folder as the program, and if the data was secretive then this would be horrendous. Overall though, most improvements would be unecessary as this does regard not much else than videogame data. The text-based interface is also well done, with clear communication of inputs, fun flavour text, explanations, and overall easy usage all throughout. Though, more communication of the behind-the-scenes code could be useful to some users, and the UI is obviously limited by the text-based nature, which may make it difficult for certain users to interaact with. Additionally, one major improvement to the functionality would be more customisation of the visualisation and filtering, though that would be hard to make clear for users, as it would require precisely correct inputs on their side. Overall, the UI and security of the program are well-done for what it is, with obvious improvements to be found.
