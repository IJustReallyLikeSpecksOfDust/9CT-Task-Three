# _Data Science Project: Console Prices_

# Identifying and Defining

## Mind Map

![My Mindmap](images\mindmap.png)
* Blue were ideas considered for longer than others.

## Hypothesis

#### "Videogame console prices have risen accordingly with inflation, and are as fairly priced as they were 20 years ago."

This includes the following consoles:

| Playstation| Xbox | Nintendo |
|---|---|---|
|PS3 (2006)| Xbox 360 (2006) | Wii (2006) |
|PS4 (2013)| Xbox One (2013)| Wii U (2012) |
|PS5 (2020) | Xbox Series S (2020) | Switch (2017) |
|PS5 Pro (2024) | Xbox Series X (2020) | Switch 2 (2025) |

## Requirements Outline

### Functional Requirements

* #### Loading
All relevant images or texts should be without error. In case of error, backup methods should be used. If those fail, make the error clear to the user and give the user direction to access data in other ways.

* ####  Cleaning
System should be able to function with minor values missing, with minimal disruption to user experience. Tools to filter or locate specific data will ideally be included.

* ####  Analysis
System should be able to provide analysis in the form of means, ranges and other useful tools, especially for comparison.

* #### Visualisation
Data should be visualised in a variety of pertinent ways, such as graphs, charts, dataframes and more. Particular focus should be given to the visualisation methods' accuracy compared to the spreadsheets.

(update this one with more specific knowledge when you know how to pandas and mpl)

* #### Outputs
Outputs should be in the form of showing the user's chosen visualisation, text representing specifically filtered data points, or easy access to the spreadsheets and datasets. Dataset will likely be stored in a .csv file.


### Non-Functional Requirements

* #### Usability
User interface should be easily navigable, understandable, and simple, whilst providing all neccesary information. A "README" document should be included to clarify what the data is, suggests, and any other necessary information. Data visualisation methods should have clarity.

* #### Reliability
System should be consistently able to access the same data with simple input, mentioned data should have and maintain integrity. System should handle errors without obfuscation, using backup processe(s) and detailed error messages to assist the user


### Use Case
__Actor:__ User

__Goal:__ To access and interact with existing data through the programâ€™s user interface.

__Preconditions:__

* The dataset has already been preloaded into the system by an administrator / programmer.

* The user has access to the system's interface.

__Main Flow:__

User opens the program and is presented with a text-based menu.

User is presented with the following options:
* a. See visualisation (Charts or graphs)
* b. Provide criteria to search or filter for data.
* c. Access the dataset for any reason (typically an update; though other reasons may exist.)

User selects one of the options and system performs the requested action and outputs to user.

__Postconditions:__

User has viewed and/or interacted with the data in any way they choose.

Updates are checked for and saved by the system (if valid).

Data remains available for further queries or analysis, maintaining  data integrity.



# Researching and Planning

### Research:
Below is a collection of links I used for research. I guess it's my sources? At least the ones for the paragraph.

### Discuss (SEE-I Paragraph)

A lot of people seem to think that videogame consoles are overpriced, and the natural inferrence most people take is that that means the companies behind them are marking up prices to increase profits, however, most gaming journalism suggests that consoles are sold at a large loss to their manufacturers. Online, a lot of people appear to have the opinion that consoles have become drastically more expensive across about the past decade. While objectively true, this doesn't account for inflation as others point out, and there's another common logic that because console makers get more profit from selling software, whether it be in retailers, through online shops, or subscription services, they keep the console price point tolerable to enable later purchases. This is seen in the modern XBox business model, as Microsoft eat a loss of over a $100 on each Series X/S sold, often more, but they make up for it with the lucrative Xbox game pass, and it's heavy success. However, what gamers see is an increase in price, and from that perspective, it does make sense to assume they're taking profit. It's like any other thing with inflation, when a person sees their favourite pizza place has raised the price of garlic bread 30%, they're obviously going to be disgruntled, yet that doesn't consider that perhaps the wheat industry had hit a tough spot, and it's priced just as accordingly. Though it is important to note that sometimes companies overdo their price raises, using inflation as an excuse, like certain major supermarket chains do.

### Acquiring Data

Note: Assume data needs to be in the time period of 2005-2025 (where applicable).
#### Data I need:
- Inflation in general across Australia, Japan & the USA,* or globally.
- Manufacturing costs of common console parts. 
- Rise in consumer prices of MAIN (sorry PSP) consoles from Sony, Microsoft & Nintendo.**
- Rise in manufacturing costs of the above consoles.


###### *Depending on ease of data acquisition 1 or 2 of the countries can be dropped.

###### **The companies should be seperated to compare between eachother.

These requirements are very malleable depending on the ease of obtaining and using it. Really all that is truly needed is console prices and inflation, in any usable shape or form. 

Data, when found, will have it's source listed beneath this line.

also my only source for the ps5 pro sales is a forum i cant find anymore and my own estimation. so basically it's made up

### Data Dictionary
I'm not sure HOW you're meant to make these, unsure if it should be a table or a dataframe or a .csv or whatever else, so right now I'll just do this as a table and we can figure the rest out later.

Some notes:
- I'm planning on using the GPU as a microchosm of the manufacturing costs as a whole, as there's data about them and its often the most expensive part of a console (at least today).  Update: There is significantly less data about these GPUs than I thought. Alternatives may be used. We'll see.
- USD and AUD are being used out of convinience.
- I am experiencing issues with sorting out nuances of the CPI rise data. A lot of them... 
- My knowledge of datatypes is limited so I did my best guesses based on example mostly.



| Field   | Datatype | Display Format | Description | Example | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Console | object | tba | The console whose data is being looked at. | Sega Dreamcast | Any character or number. No other symbols. |
| Company | object | tba | The videogame company behind the console. | Atari | Unlimited
| Price (USD) | float64 | NNN | Rounded up consumer price of the console on release, in USD. | 250 | Three numbers with no decimal places. |
| Price (AUD) | float64 | NNN/NNNN* | Rounded up consumer price of the console on release, in AUD. | 450 | Three or Four numbers with no decimal places. |
| GPU Price (USD) | float64 | NN/NNN* | Rounded up price of the console's GPU on release, in USD | 170 | Two or three numbers with no decimal places. |
| Release Date | datetime64 | YYYY-MM-DD | Date where the console released internationally. | 2008-02-29 | Must be in the format of YYYY-MM-DD. |
| Global CPI rise** | tba | % | Percentage rise in global CPI since the company's last console release. | 11% | An integer percentage. |

*I don't know how to represent different potential amounts of numbers in the display format.
**Gotta be a more descriptive way to phrase that.

Honestly I will probably redo this later.
